                consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Prison. He is
                befriended by Ellis "Red" Redding, an inmate and prison
                contraband smuggler serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock
                hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to

            <h1>Forrest Gump</h1>
            <p>
                In 1951, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg
                braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk
                properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding
                house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a
                young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and
                incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his
                performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl
                named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.
